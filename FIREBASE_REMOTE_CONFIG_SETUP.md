# Firebase Remote Config Setup for AI Coach

## üìã Overview

The AI Coach system uses Firebase Remote Config to store AI prompts. This allows easy updates to prompts in production without code changes.

---

## üîë Required Remote Config Parameters

### 1. **prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation** (REQUIRED - Updated)

**Description**: Prompt for generating macrocycle and mesocycle goals (Phase 1 of AI Coach)

**Value**: Copy contents from `prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation.json`

**IMPORTANT CHANGES:**
- ‚úÖ App now generates IDs, startDate, endDate, generated_at (not AI)
- ‚úÖ AI only provides content: name, value, durationWeeks, successIndicators
- ‚úÖ Simplified prompt for better reliability
- ‚úÖ Handles both new and old response formats for backward compatibility

**How to add/update in Firebase Console**:
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Remote Config
2. If parameter exists, click "Edit" | If new, click "Add parameter"
3. Parameter key: `prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation`
4. Data type: JSON
5. Default value: Paste the UPDATED JSON from `prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation.json`
6. Click "Save" then "Publish changes"

**‚ö†Ô∏è If you already uploaded the old version, please UPDATE it with the new simplified version!**

---

### 2. **prompts_fitness_plan_generation** (EXISTING - Reused for workouts)

**Description**: Prompt for generating initial week workouts (used for Week 1 generation)

**Status**: Already exists, but needs to be updated to match new structure

**Value**: Copy contents from `prompts_ai_coach_workout_generation.json` (or update existing)

**Note**: This prompt is reused from the existing fitness plan system. If you want separate prompts, create a new parameter `prompts_ai_coach_workout_generation`.

---

### 3. **openai_api_key** (EXISTING - Required)

**Description**: OpenAI API key for GPT-4

**Status**: Should already exist

**Value**: Your OpenAI API key (sk-...)

---

## üìÑ Prompt Files Created

I've created two JSON files in your project root with the prompts:

### **1. `prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation.json`**
- Prompt for Phase 1 (Goals Generation)
- Defines JSON schema for macrocycle + mesocycles
- Template variables:
  - `{USER_PROFILE}` - Full user profile data
  - `{FITNESS_GOAL_INPUT}` - Goal from profile field
  - `{CUSTOM_INPUT}` - User's detailed description
  - `{CURRENT_DATE}` - Current date

### **2. `prompts_ai_coach_workout_generation.json`**
- Prompt for Phase 2 (Workout Generation)
- Defines JSON schema for weekly workouts
- Template variables:
  - `{USER_PROFILE}` - Full user profile
  - `{MACROCYCLE}` - Macrocycle goal
  - `{MESOCYCLE}` - Current mesocycle
  - `{NEXT_WEEK_NUMBER}` - Week number
  - `{WEEK_DATE_RANGE}` - Week start/end dates
  - `{CURRENT_DATE}` - Current date
  - `{PREVIOUS_MICROCYCLE_PLANNED}` - Previous week planned workouts
  - `{PREVIOUS_MICROCYCLE_ACTUAL}` - Previous week actual completion
  - `{WORKOUT_HISTORY}` - Historical workout data
  - `{CUSTOM_PROMPT}` - User feedback for regeneration

## üöÄ How to Upload to Firebase

### Step 1: Goals Generation Prompt

```bash
# 1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
# 2. Select your project
# 3. Navigate to: Remote Config (in left sidebar)
# 4. Click "Add parameter"
# 5. Fill in:
#    - Parameter key: prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation
#    - Data type: JSON
#    - Default value: [paste contents from prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation.json]
# 6. Click "Save"
# 7. Click "Publish changes" (top right)
```

### Step 2: Workout Generation Prompt (Optional)

If you want a separate prompt for AI Coach workouts:

```bash
# Same process as above, but:
# - Parameter key: prompts_ai_coach_workout_generation
# - Default value: [paste contents from prompts_ai_coach_workout_generation.json]
```

**OR** just update the existing `prompts_fitness_plan_generation` parameter.

## üß™ Testing After Upload

### Test Goals Generation

1. Navigate to AI Coach page (`/app/ai-coach`)
2. Click "Start AI Coach"
3. Fill in fitness goals
4. Click "Generate Goals"
5. Check browser console for:
   - `[AICoach] Starting goals generation`
   - `[AICoach] Calling OpenAI API for goals generation`
   - `[AICoach] Parsing AI response: {...}`
   - `[AICoach] Generated goals successfully`

### If You See Errors

**Error: "Goals generation prompt not configured"**
- Firebase Remote Config parameter not found
- Check parameter name is exactly: `prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation`
- Check you published changes in Firebase Console

**Error: "Failed to parse AI response as JSON"**
- AI returned invalid JSON
- Check console for the actual response
- May need to adjust system prompt to enforce JSON-only output

**Error: "Invalid goals response structure"**
- AI returned JSON but wrong structure
- Check console for what fields were received
- May need to make prompt more explicit about required fields

## ‚öôÔ∏è Current Implementation

**What the app currently does**:

1. **Goals Generation**:
   - Tries to load: `prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation`
   - Falls back to: `prompts_fitness_plan_generation` (if not found)
   - Expects response with `macrocycleGoal` and `mesocycleMilestones`

2. **Workout Generation**:
   - Loads: `prompts_fitness_plan_generation` (existing prompt)
   - Expects response with `plan.currentMicrocycle.workouts`

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive validation of AI response
   - Detailed console logging
   - User-friendly error messages

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Upload `prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation` to Firebase** (REQUIRED)
2. **Optional**: Upload `prompts_ai_coach_workout_generation` (or keep using existing)
3. **Test goals generation** with real AI
4. **Iterate on prompts** if AI output doesn't match expectations

---

**Files to upload to Firebase Remote Config:**
- ‚úÖ `prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation.json` ‚Üí parameter: `prompts_ai_coach_goals_generation`
- ‚úÖ `prompts_ai_coach_workout_generation.json` ‚Üí parameter: `prompts_ai_coach_workout_generation` (optional)
- ‚úÖ Ensure `openai_api_key` parameter exists with your API key

**Once uploaded, the AI Coach will work end-to-end!** üöÄ
